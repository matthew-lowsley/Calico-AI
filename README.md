# Observations of Reinforcement Learning Agents in a Highly Stochastic Environment
**Supervisor:** Vasilios Kelefouras
## Project Vision:

The recent growth of AI has seen the large improvements in so-called boardgame playing programs. However, much of this area of research focuses on highly deterministic games with fixed outcomes and strategies, instead, I would like to observe the effectiveness of various machine learning techniques in a highly stochastic environment, where an agent’s plans may need to change and adapt based on differing environmental pressures. 

To achieve this, I will train multiple agents to play the 2020 boardgame *Calico* designed by Kevin Russ. *Calcio’s* gameplay forces players to be both strategic and improvisational allowing me to closely observe how the agents react to specific scenarios.
